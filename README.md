2. Configure the following options:
   - **Vault Name**: Enter the name of your Obsidian vault
   - **Vault Base Path**: Set the path to your Obsidian vault folder (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Notes)
   - **Inbox Folder**: Specify the folder within your vault where emails should be saved (default: "Inbox")
   - **Launch Obsidian**: Toggle whether Obsidian should automatically open after saving an email
   - **Delay (seconds)**: Set how long to wait before launching Obsidian (default: 1 second)

   - **Use Relative Dates**: Choose between relative or absolute date mode:
     - When enabled (relative): Reminder days are calculated backwards from the due date
     - When disabled (absolute): Reminder date is calculated forward from today
   - **Reminder Days**: Set the default reminder timing:
     - In relative mode: How many days before the due date
     - In absolute mode: How many days from today
   - **Reminder Hour**: Set the default hour for task reminders (24-hour format)
   - **Ask for dates**: Toggle whether to prompt for dates each time (shows the Task Options form)

3. Click "Save" to apply your settings

Note: Make sure your Vault Base Path points to an existing Obsidian vault directory. If you haven't created a vault yet, please set one up in Obsidian first.

## Task Creation

When task creation is enabled, SlingMD can create follow-up tasks in two locations:

### Obsidian Tasks
- Created at the top of the note
- Uses Obsidian's task format with date metadata
- Links back to the email note
- Tagged with #FollowUp for easy tracking

### Outlook Tasks
- Creates a task in your Outlook task list
- Includes the email subject and content
- Configurable due date (0-30 days from creation)
- Configurable reminder time (0-23 hour)
- Option to prompt for due date and reminder time for each task

## Task Options

When "Ask for dates" is enabled, the Task Options form will appear when creating tasks. This form allows you to:

1. Set the due date using either:
   - Relative mode: Specify number of days from today
   - Absolute mode: Pick a specific date from a calendar

2. Set the reminder using either:
   - Relative mode: Specify number of days before the due date
   - Absolute mode: Pick a specific date from a calendar

3. Set the reminder hour (in 24-hour format)

The "Use Relative Dates" toggle switches between:
- Relative mode: Reminder is set relative to the due date (e.g., "remind me 2 days before it's due")
- Absolute mode: Reminder is set to a specific date (e.g., "remind me next Tuesday")
